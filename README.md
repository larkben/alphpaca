## ALPHPACAS ##

### What is ALPHpacas?
`alphpacas` - is a passion project founded by myself and built up by various developers that have come onto Alephium to build. 

ALPHpacas is a token with roughly ~11 million circulating with no inital ICO (all airdropped or giveaways); our main attractions are:

`Token Creator` - create a token on Alephium <br/>
`Gamify Protocol` - taking regular nfts and giving them gamefi elements for the masses (in development) <br/>
`Alpaca Loans` - create hi-risk (~high apy) loans or liquid loans (lower risk) to create a strategic financial position and or create a leveraged position <br/>

### Side Utils

`Walf Protocol` - convert 1 OG ALF into its wrapped variant <br/>
`Wang Wrapper` - convert group 2 wang over into group 0 <br/>

### What can I do with them?

Besides being cute, cuddly and collectible ALPHpacas represent being an early member of the Alephium community and will always be the first priority with any of the games we make.

### Who is the team?

larkben - smart contract developer and average web developer (cofounder of ALPHaga NFT Marketplace) <br/>
overgames - talented backend and frontend web developer (cofounder of ALPHaga NFT Marketplace)
