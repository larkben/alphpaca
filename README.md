## ALPHPACAS ##

### What is ALPHpacas?
`alphpacas` - is a passion project founded by myself and built up by various developers that have come onto Alephium to build. 

ALPHpacas is a token with roughly ~11 million circulating with no inital ICO (all airdropped or giveaways); our main attractions are:

`Token Creator` - create a token on Alephium <br/>
`Gamify Protocol` - taking regular nfts and giving them gamefi elements for the masses (in development) <br/>
`Alpaca Loans` - create hi-risk (~high apy) loans or liquid loans (lower risk) to create a strategic financial position and or create a leveraged position <br/>

### Side Utils

`Walf Protocol` - convert 1 OG ALF into its wrapped variant <br/>
`Wang Wrapper` - convert group 2 wang over into group 0 <br/>

### NFTS?

Besides being cute, cuddly and collectible ALPHpacas represent being an early member of the Alephium community and will always be the first priority with any of the games we make.

### Who is the team?

larkben - smart contract developer and average web developer (cofounder of ALPHaga NFT Marketplace) <br/>
overgames - talented backend and frontend web developer (cofounder of ALPHaga NFT Marketplace)
